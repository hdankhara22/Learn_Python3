2. Append Sum

Letâ€™s create a function that calculates the sum of the last two elements of a list and appends it to the end. After doing so, it will repeat this process two more times and return the resulting list. You can choose to use a loop or manually use three lines. Here are the steps we need:

Define the function to accept one parameter for our list of numbers
Add the last and second to last elements from our list together
Append the calculated value to the end of our list.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 two more times
Return the modified list
