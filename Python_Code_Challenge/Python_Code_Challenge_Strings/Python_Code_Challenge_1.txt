1. Count Letters

For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Here is what we need to do:

Define the function to accept one parameter â€” the word whose letters we are counting
Create a counter to keep track of unique letters
Loop through every letter in our alphabet string. If the current letter was found in our word, increase our count
Return the count after looping through all letters.
