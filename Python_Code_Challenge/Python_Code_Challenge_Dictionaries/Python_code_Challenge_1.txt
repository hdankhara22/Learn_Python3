1. Sum Values

For the first code challenge, we are going to look at only the values in a dictionary. This function should sum up all of the values from the key-value pairs in the dictionary. Here are the steps we need:

Define the function to accept one parameter for our dictionary
Create a variable to keep track of our sum
Loop through every value in the dictionary
Inside the loop, add each value to the sum
Return the sum
