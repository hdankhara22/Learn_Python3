2. Even Keys

Next, we are going to do something similar, but we are going to use the keys in order to retrieve the values. Additionally, we are going to only look at every even key within the dictionary. Here are the steps:

Define the function to accept one parameter for our dictionary
Create a variable to keep track of our sum
Loop through every key in the dictionary
Inside the loop, if the key is even, add the value from the even key
After the loop, return the sum
