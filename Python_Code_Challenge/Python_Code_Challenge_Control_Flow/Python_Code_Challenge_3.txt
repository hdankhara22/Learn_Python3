3. Twice As Large

In this challenge, we will determine if one number is twice as large as another number. To do this, we will compare the first number with two times the second number. Here are the steps:

Define our function with two inputs num1 and num2
Multiply the second input by 2
Use an if statement to compare the result of the last calculation with the first input
If num1 is greater then return True otherwise return False
